# WebWorks Studio — Module 9 Student Starter

## Mission City Makers Market

You are the **Junior Front-End Developer** assigned to improve a fictional client page using two different professional tools:

1. **Alpine.js** — create one lightweight custom interaction.
2. **Preline UI** — choose and adapt one reusable component.

The goal is not to add as many effects as possible. The goal is to choose the right tool for the right job.

## Start Here

Open this entire folder in Visual Studio Code.

In the VS Code terminal, run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Keep `npm run dev` running while you work.

The `dev` command:

- copies Preline's browser JavaScript to `js/vendor/preline.js`;
- starts Tailwind watch mode;
- rebuilds `css/output.css` when your HTML changes.

Preview `index.html` with Live Server.

## What Is Already Set Up?

- Tailwind CSS 4
- Preline UI
- Tailwind Forms
- Alpine.js through the approved CDN
- responsive client page
- accessible baseline HTML
- client content and starter images
- clearly marked Alpine and Preline work areas
- Mac/Windows-friendly npm scripts

### Versions

- Tailwind CSS 4.3.3
- Tailwind CLI 4.3.3
- Preline UI 4.2.0
- Tailwind Forms 0.5.11
- Alpine.js CDN 3.17.1

Do not change versions unless your instructor tells you to.

# Requirement 1 — Alpine-Powered Exploration Tool

Use Alpine to help a visitor explore, narrow, compare, select, or better understand the supplied maker content.

Required:

- `x-data`
- at least one user event
- at least one additional reactive directive
- visible, understandable interface response
- semantic, keyboard-accessible controls

Search `index.html` for:

`TODO: REQUIRED ALPINE INTERACTION`

Do not copy the classroom Alpine playground unchanged.

# Requirement 2 — Adapted Preline Component

Choose one Preline component that improves the supplied client page.

Possible choices:

- accordion
- tabs
- modal
- dropdown
- alert
- another instructor-approved component

Required:

- solve a real client/user need
- use official Preline structure
- retain meaningful client content
- adapt styling with Tailwind utilities
- remain keyboard usable
- preserve accessibility behavior
- work at narrow, medium, and wide widths

Search `index.html` for:

`TODO: REQUIRED PRELINE COMPONENT`

# Scope Rule

Your Alpine interaction and Preline component must solve **different problems**.

# Why `js/vendor/preline.js` Exists

`node_modules` should not be committed or relied on by GitHub Pages.

Running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or:

```bash
npm run build
```

copies Preline from:

```text
node_modules/preline/dist/preline.js
```

to:

```text
js/vendor/preline.js
```

Commit the copied runtime with your finished project.

# Before Pushing to GitHub

Run:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then confirm these contain real generated code:

```text
css/output.css
js/vendor/preline.js
```

Commit both files.

Do not commit `node_modules/`.

# Required README Documentation

Replace each TODO before submitting.

## Project Summary

Alpine was installed and inserted into element classes with the @click. this allowed the market cards to have a similar affect to the accordion. For preline, I was able to properly do the accordion component due to the documentation given to us to use. Lastly I wasn't sure if we were suppose to edit the tailwind at first, so I left it with the original code, which I feel like I should've changed to better suit these frameworks.

## Alpine Decision

**User/client need:**  
Easier navigation and exploration for visitors

**Alpine directives used:**  
Used x-data and @click to have it mimic the accordion component.

**Why Alpine was appropriate:**  
made editing the js alot easier for us.

## Preline Decision

**Preline component selected:**  
Accordion

**Problem it solves:**  
sorts information into groups allowing you to click on the information you currently need to prevent clutter.

**How you adapted it:**  
I input it through a div command, with the use of preline.
I kept the first section in the accordion active as the step mentioned.

## Accessibility Notes

1. TODO
2. TODO

## Testing Notes

**Narrow viewport:** WORKS  
**Medium viewport:** WORKS  
**Wide viewport:** WORKS BUT PAGE DESIGN NEEDS WORK
**Keyboard testing:** WORKS ON ALL BUT ALPINE JS
**Browser console:** NO ERROR AS OF NOW

## Dependencies

**Alpine.js — how used:** used in div, images and on the title
**Preline UI — how used:** split between the title making it a button and paragraph
**Tailwind CSS — how used:** used grid and other descriptive elements to build the sites ui.
